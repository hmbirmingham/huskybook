# Build Log — Campus Cuts

This is a running log, written as I go, not reconstructed afterward. Entries are grouped by branch/phase in the order I actually did them. Git history is the ground truth for *what* changed line by line; this is the *why*.

## Phase 0 — Repo scaffold (2026-09-08)

**What I'm building:** the empty shell — root `package.json`, `.gitignore`, README stub, and this log — before any feature code.

**Decisions:**

- **npm workspaces (`client/`, `server/`) over a single flat app.** The frontend and backend have genuinely different toolchains (Vite vs. a plain Node process) and I don't want Vite's dependency tree tangled up with Express's. Workspaces let `npm install` at the root wire up both, and `npm run dev` at the root fans out to both via `concurrently`, so the "one command to run everything" requirement still holds without faking a monolith.
- **Not using create-vite or create-react-app scaffolding directly** — building the client by hand in the next phase so the file layout matches the app's actual shape (pages for the four flows, not a generic template) instead of stripping out boilerplate afterward.
- Committing this scaffold straight to `main` rather than a branch. There's no feature here to isolate — it's the equivalent of `git init` — and having *something* runnable at every point on `main`, even if it's just "npm install succeeds," is the property I want to hold from commit one. Everything after this goes through a feature branch + PR.

**Deferred:** choice of backend (SQLite vs. Firebase/Supabase) and the exact schema — that's the first real decision and it gets its own phase below, done as a branch.
